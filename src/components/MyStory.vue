    The brightest star in this universe, SIRIUS got its brightness from this
    person called Bharti Pai. In this chaotic cosmic concidience, I met the most
    beautiful girl, the first love of my life, Bharthi Pai. I can save some time
    of researchers by concluding that the atomic consituent of this being are
    directly from The Big Bang, hence the purest form of every element. These
    are not even metaphors, these are facts
